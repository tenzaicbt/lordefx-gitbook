# CONFLICTS

## Understanding the Issue

Conflicts often arise due to overlapping resources or compatibility issues between different map creators’ work. It’s important to note that these conflicts are not solely due to any one party but are a mutual challenge between creators.

## Our Approach

Our team has made considerable efforts to assist customers with resolving these conflicts, even though this responsibility extends to both us and other creators. Due to the extensive workload and the complex nature of resolving these issues, we have decided to provide you with a detailed tutorial to help you resolve conflicts independently.

### Steps to Resolve Conflicts

1. **Access Map Data**
   * Ensure you are using our updated map data. Log in with your FiveM account to access the necessary files.
2. **Update Server Configuration**
   * It’s crucial to add and start the map data in your `server.cfg` file. This step ensures that the correct map files are loaded and minimizes the risk of conflicts.
3. **Follow the Tutorial**
   * We have created a comprehensive tutorial to guide you through the process of resolving conflicts. Please follow the instructions carefully to address any issues effectively.

## Additional Information

Resolving conflicts can be challenging due to the intricacies of how FiveM handles map data and interactions between different resources. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation as we work together to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience.
